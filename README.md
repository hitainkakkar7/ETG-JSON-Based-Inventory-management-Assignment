# ETG-JSON-Based-Inventory-management-Assignment


This is an json based inventory management system built using python(json) and created on google colab.
I have developed this project as a part of hands on project which i recieved due to my "Skill India Python for ML/AI" Internship from #EliteTechnoGroups.

Thank you [Elite Techno Groups](https://www.elitetechnogroups.com/) for this internship opportunity and looking to learn more such knowledgeable stuff from you and the internship Guides.
Thank you [Ashish Jangra](https://github.com/AshishJangra27/) (Mentor) for guiding me make this project from scratch.

2. New Inventory can be added.
3. Purchase can be done.

### Features
1. Importing library for easy use
2. Then saving 30 items' details in dictionary type
3. Writing & Reading data of JSON file
4. Adding + Deleting + Purchasing Items
5. Loop is used to know whether the customer wants to buy more items or not
6. Total Cost of the item's or Billing Amount is calculated

#### I've added following features per product

#### My Project can do the following things
1. Generate Bills
2. Update Inventory
3. Purchase for Customers
4. Add Items to Inventory
